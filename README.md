Holo1 is H Company‚Äôs Action Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Surfer-H is the agent that enacts it in the real world. Together, they provide a powerful, automated, yet optimized solution to interacting with web interfaces the way we do‚Äîsetting a goal, taking decisions, re-thinking and re-assessing where needed, and, ultimately, fulfilling everyday tasks. Holo1 and Surfer-H have been designed and built to do everything from booking flights, to searching for recipes online, and more.



# Holo1

[Holo1](https://huggingface.co/collections/Hcompany/holo1-683dd1eece7eb077b96d0cbd) is an Action Vision-Language Model (VLM) developed by¬†[**H Company**](https://www.hcompany.ai/)¬†for use in Surfer-H. It enables the agent to understand and act in digital environments. Holo1 is built based on 3 core components that shape and determine its behaviour: policy, localizer, and validator. These are defined below:

- **Policy**: Determines what action should be taken.
- **Localizer**: Locates elements on the screen‚Äîlike buttons, text fields, or key UI attributes.
- **Validator**: Decides whether it succeeded or failed in doing what it set out to do.

Trained on a combination of open-access, synthetic, and self-generated data, Holo1 enables state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the WebVoyager benchmark, offering the best accuracy/cost tradeoff among current models. It also excels in UI localization tasks such as Screenspot, Screenspot-V2, Screenspot-Pro, GroundUI-Web, and our own newly introduced benchmark, WebClick. Holo1 is optimized for both accuracy and cost-efficiency, making it a strong open-source alternative to existing VLMs. Currently, there are two Holo1 models:

| Model                                                 | Size         | Tensor type | General purpose                                        | Use case         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| [Holo1 3B](https://huggingface.co/Hcompany/Holo1-3B) | 3.75B params | BF16        | Optimized for efficiency, running locally, and hardware | Common tasks     |
| [Holo1 7B](https://huggingface.co/Hcompany/Holo1-7B) | 8.29B params | BF16        | Higher accuracy and for large scale inference          | Full-scale tasks |

# Surfer-H

The Surfer-H agent brings Holo1's vision to life. Surfer-H is capable of taking action and interacting with the world. It can see what‚Äôs on the screen, take decisions, interact with a UI by clicking buttons and scrolling, or navigating from page to page to fulfill everyday tasks like booking flights or shopping online. It‚Äôs also capable of recognizing when it has completed its task ‚Äî or when it needs to pause, reassess, and try again. We‚Äôve open-sourced Surfer‚ÄëH to share its capabilities and power with the world.

# Get started

This guide shows you how to deploy Holo1 (3b and 7b). You must first deploy the Holo1 model before launching the Surfer-H agent.

## Methods

There are different methods and contexts in which to deploy Holo1, including:

| Method                                                                                             | Pre-requisites                                | Notes                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Local vLLM setup](src/surfer_h_cli/holo1/README.md)             | Install vLLM / Machine with GPU           | Uses the vLLM to download Holo1 from HuggingFace.                                                  |
| [Local Docker Container](https://github.com/hcompai/hai-cookbook/tree/main/holo1/vllm)             | Install Docker / Machine with GPU              | Uses the `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.9.1` image.                                                  |
| [Amazon SageMaker](https://github.com/hcompai/hai-cookbook/blob/main/holo1/sagemaker/deploy.ipynb) | Subscribe to Holo1 Models on AWS Marketplace | Deploys the Holo1 model via a prebuilt Notebook. No manual or complicated setup required. |


For more information, check out the [H.AI Cookbook](https://github.com/hcompai/hai-cookbook).

## Environment setup

Set your environment variables using one of two methods, outlined below:

**Option 1: Create a `.env` at the root of this repo**:
```
HAI_API_KEY=your_hai_api_key_here
HAI_MODEL_URL=https://your-api-endpoint-url/
HAI_MODEL_NAME=hosted model name, for example Hcompany/Holo1-7B
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
Note: Make sure your .env file ends with a blank (empty) line. This helps ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and other variables are correctly loaded by the bash scripts.

**Option 2: Export in your shell profile** (for global setup):
Add these to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` files:
```
export HAI_API_KEY=...
export HAI_MODEL_URL=...
export HAI_MODEL_NAME=...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

When running `vllm`, you can leave the `HAI_API_KEY` empty (or set it to any value), and set `HAI_MODEL_URL` to `http://localhost:PORT` using the port where your local `vllm` instance is running.

## Run the agent

If you're serving your own model using vLLM, start the server with:

```bash
export HAI_API_KEY=EMPTY
export HAI_MODEL_URL=http://localhost:8082/v1
export HAI_MODEL_NAME=Hcompany/Holo1-7B
vllm serve Hcompany/Holo1-7B --port 8082
```

You can then run the agent from the Surfer-H-CLI using the following command:

```bash
./run-on-holo.sh
```
Here are the different run settings that may apply based on use and context:

- ```run-on-holo.sh``` : Use Holo1 for navigation and localization, hosted remotely.
- ```run-on-holo-local.sh``` : Script with specific instruction for using one or several locally hosted Holo1.
- ```run-on-holo-val-gpt41.sh``` : Use remotely-hosted Holo1 and GPT-4.1 for validation.

The above scripts call the agent like this, with different configurations for the placeholders:

```bash
MODEL="<model name for endpoint>"
TASK=""On Google flights. Find a one-way business class flight from Buenos Aires to Amsterdam on the 10th of next month, and provide the details of the flight with the shortest duration.""
URL="https://www.google.com/travel/flights"

uv run src/surfer_h_cli/surferh.py \
    --task "$TASK" \
    --url "$URL" \
    --max_n_steps 30 \
    --base_url_localization https://<openai-api-compatible-endpoint-such-as-vllm> \
    --model_name_localization $MODEL \
    --temperature_localization 0.0 \
    --base_url_navigation https://<openai-api-compatible-endpoint-such-as-vllm> \
    --model_name_navigation $MODEL \
    --temperature_navigation 0.7 \

```
### Using GPT for Validation
To run ```run-on-holo-val-gpt41.sh```, remember to export your OpenAI API key for validation:
```
export API_KEY_VALIDATION=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
```
and define the correct base URL
```
--base_url_validation https://api.openai.com/v1/
```

## Frontend Interface

In addition to the command-line interface, Surfer-H includes a modern web frontend that provides an intuitive way to interact with the agent. The frontend offers several advantages over the CLI:

### Features

- **Task Creation**: Simply describe what you want to accomplish in natural language through a web interface
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch your agent complete tasks with live updates
- **Trajectory Management**: View, replay, and manage automated browsing sequences
- **Settings Configuration**: Easily customize agent behavior, target URLs, and execution parameters through a UI
- **Example Tasks**: Get started quickly with pre-configured example prompts

### Quick Start

The easiest way to start both the backend and frontend together is to run from the root directory:

```bash
./launch.sh
```

This command will automatically start both the Surfer-H backend and the Next.js frontend, making the web interface available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## View a sample run
The video below shows Surfer-H in action, demonstrating how the agent completes a real-world task by thinking, reasoning, and browsing the web based on a prompt. This demo (hosted on **YouTube**) illustrates what to expect when running an agent using the Surfer-H-CLI with the command `./run-on-holo.sh.`
